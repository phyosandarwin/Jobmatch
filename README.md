# JobMatch

**About**
---
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on **job placement statuses in developing countries** from Job Placement Status Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/job-placement-dataset). 

For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Numeric
   - Categorical
3. Machine Learning Models
4. Data-Driven Insights


**Problem Definition**
---
What are the more important hiring conditons in developing countries?


**Models used**
---
   >- Decision Tree Classifier
   >- Logistic Regression
   >- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
**Conclusion**
---


**What did we learn from the project?**
---
- Use of chi-square statistic for correlation analysis of categorical varibles
- Use of F1 score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC score as model performance evaluation metrics
- Use of RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) as a feature selection technique
- Logistic regression and SVM from sklearn
- Collaborating using GitHub
